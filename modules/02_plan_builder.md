### **Module 2 — Plan Builder (Options → Days)**

Change Log (2025-11-23):Refined Module 2 based on AI critique—added proximity rules, dietary consistency, and theme diversity guidance.

Change Log (2025-11-16): Updated restaurant to support & accommodate vegan dietary restrictions.

Create a short list of candidate activities (e.g., attractions, restaurants, parks). Each activity must include:

Type and brief description

Estimated duration

Opening hours

Cost range ($$)

Accessibility notes (e.g., step-free, indoor/outdoor)

Distance and estimated transfer time

Use a simple loop to build days:

for each day:

Morning activity → near lodging (≤ 15 minutes walk or ≤ 2–3 km)

Midday activity → close by (≤ 20 minutes transit, ≤ 5 km)

Afternoon activity → different theme than morning/midday (e.g., culture → nature → food)

Evening meal/event → restaurant or optional event, ensuring dietary compliance (vegan or other restrictions applied across all meals when needed)

Additional refinements:

Apply basic checks for opening hours during candidate selection; exclude venues closed at planned times.

Enforce transfer limits (≤ 25 minutes or ≤ 5 km) between activities to reduce later swaps.

Ensure theme diversity: avoid repeating the same type of activity more than twice per day.

When dietary restrictions are noted, ensure breakfast, lunch, and dinner options are compliant.

Include indoor alternatives for each time block when season/weather suggests rain or cold.
